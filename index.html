                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>Naruto Uzumaki is the titular protagonist of the Naruto franchise and one of the titular 
                    characters as well as one of the main supporting characters in the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime/manga series. 
                    He is the son of Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, the husband of Hinata Hyūga, 
                    the father of Boruto Uzumaki and Himawari Uzumaki, and the adoptive father of Kawaki.

                    <br>
                    He is a shinobi of Konohagakure, who lived his early childhood as an outcast when he was 
                    turned into the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails at birth. Nonetheless, he worked his way through 
                    many obstacles and achievements in hopes of achieving his dream of becoming Hokage. 
                    Having done so much for many, he was recognized across the world as a hero and was 
                    eventually able to become the Seventh Hokage of Konohagakure.

                <h3>Personality</h3>
                <p>Naruto is a boisterous and exuberant boy. He would end sentences with "Dattebayo!" (だってばよ!) 
                    when excited or frustrated. He has a number of childish traits, such as being a very picky eater 
                    (he almost exclusively eats ramen), being afraid of ghosts, and carries a chubby green-frog wallet 
                    which he calls "Gama-chan". Naruto is heedless to formality or social standings and has a habit of 
                    giving people he meets nicknames or addressing them without appropriate honourifics, as shown when he 
                    opted to call the Second Hokage a name he thought of off the top of his head instead of simply 
                    "Lord Second" (二代目様, Nidaime-sama).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    He can also be quite perverted, creating different forms of his Sexy Technique and once 
                    tried to sneak a peek in the women's bath when the opportunity presented itself. 
                    Despite these, plus other quirks and the great amounts of criticism that follows them, 
                    Naruto is said to have a personality that brings people to him, inspiring friendship, 
                    loyalty and love from most of the people he meets through acts of genuine kindness and 
                    sincerity that could change a person's entire world view. For example, during the Fourth 
                    Shinobi World War, Naruto's kindness inspired loyalty from the tailed beasts, and when linked 
                    to the entire Shinobi Alliance through telepathy, he reignited the demoralized armies' 
                    fighting spirit, choosing to continue fighting despite the losses he could receive, as 
                    shinobi were meant to endure through hardships. On several occasions, the Second Hokage has 
                    stated in many ways Naruto is very similar to the First Hokage.

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>As stated by Jiraiya, Naruto bears a striking resemblance to his father, having Minato's 
                    blue eyes, blond, spiky hair and face. From his mother, Naruto inherited the shape of her eyes. 
                    During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Dan Katō initially mistook him for Nawaki due to their stark 
                    resemblance as well. Naruto's most prominent physical characteristics, however, are the three whisker 
                    markings on his cheeks. His most regularly mentioned trait before the second half of the series 
                    (which easily provoked him) was his short stature for his age. Over time, Naruto continued to grow as 
                    after the time skip, he was taller than his team-mate, Sakura. Two years after the Fourth Shinobi World War
                    and by the time he became Hokage, Naruto became one of the tallest of his generation.
